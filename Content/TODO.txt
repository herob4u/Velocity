- Subimage extraction
- Cubemap - 6 independent images, one texture
- Skybox  - special cubemap that can extract 6 independent images, forwards to cubemap, and
  contains draw information.
- CameraController!!!!!
- Redesign ShaderProgram, doesn't fit nicely with Resource system.
- Specialize ShaderMgr to handle the loading of the .vs and .fs files. Right now, can only load one.
- Move ResourceMgrs registration away from Renderer constructor to decouple dependencies. Must be done
as part of a global init.
